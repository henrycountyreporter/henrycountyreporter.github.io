 <strong> History:</strong> 
 <hr>
Two Henry County natives, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recy_Taylor"> Recy Taylor</a> and Pulitzer prize-winning journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_C._Hall">Grover C. Hall</a> were the inspiration behind its creation. Hall wrote in the 1930’s speaking out against the Klan in southeast Alabama and was an early advocate for the Civil Rights movement while writing in the <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/title_7946/alabama_journal/">Alabama Journal</a>. 
In 2010 officials removed a sign honoring Hall due to his support of the civil rights movement and later refused to allow a opening of the film in Abbeville about Recy Taylor that received global recognition in <a href="https://www.therapeofrecytaylor.com">The Rape of Recy Taylor</a> by Nancy Buirski. Pelham and Carroll launched the newspaper in response.
 
<p><strong>“The Reporter”</strong> as it was known locally focused on covering issues of judicial and legislative corruption in what is described as the “news desert” of southeast Alabama. 
<a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/measuring-illegal-and-legal-corruption-american-states-some-results-safra">Harvard University’s Edward Safra Center for Government Ethics</a> ranked the region as having one of the most corrupt judicial systems in the United States.
In 2013 it received a grant from the <a href="https://www.highlandercenter.org">Highlander Research and Education Center</a> to address marginalized voices in the community. Carroll recieved the Zilphia P. Horton award and was trained as a community advocate.
 <p>
  <strong> Controversy:</strong>
 <hr>
The newspaper became controversial among residents linked to white supremacy groups exposing issues of racial disparity in the courts that the Dothan Eagle and Abbeville Herald (local newspapers) had long ignored and that the Harvard study noted.
   
  <p>Pelham published a series of articles and interviews about the Eufaula Police Chief Ralph Connor’s shooting of an unarmed man Cameron Massey. Pelham revealed a background check had not been performed before the chief’s hire that would have revealed another shooting of an unarmed black man in the back while he was a police officer in Montgomery Alabama. The city had settled with the family of that victim. 
The newspaper then published leaked bodycam footgage from the shooting revealing Massey was unarmed and wearing a seatbelt as a passenger in the car. The chief subsequently resigned and Pelham's story recieved national attention and was picked up by Buzzfeed and the New Republic.
   <p>
   Pelham and Carroll were it most frequent writers. Pelham wrote about state politics and Carroll wrote a weekly column about livestock and routinely focused on the district attorney (Doug Valeska) for Henry and Houston counties (20th judicial district). The articles contained hundreds of leaked documents revealing the prosecutor’s office corruption and racism. They exposed the prosecutor’s office had targeted minorities and arranged all-white juries to convict black defendants. In 2013 Carroll started interviewing people monthy about their experiences in the court system which gave people insight into how minorities - black and poor rural whites were treated. The stories were very disturbing and explained the Harvard ranking.
    One circuit judge was famously caught stating, "this is Alabama we dont have a constituion down here".

<p> Interview with Kenneth Moffit by Jon B. Carroll for the Henry County Reporter.</p>
     <p>
    
 In 2014 Carroll and Pelham wrote articles about Kharon Davis, an inmate held in the Houston county jail for nearly a decade and denied a trial. The local newspaper, the Dothan Eagle, long a supporter of the prosecutor and police department, refused to publish information about the case nor would the district attorney’s office acknowledge the case. Carroll broke the story by interviewing the mother and then met with the New York Time’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/us/alabama-kharon-davis-speedy.html">Serge Kovawleski who ran a series of articles</a> that brought national attention. Davis remains the longest-held person arrested for a crime and denied a trial in American jurisprudence history.

  <strong> Lawsuits:</strong>
<hr>
In 2015 Carroll published a <a href="https://medium.com/@jonbcarroll/leaked-documents-reveal-dothan-police-department-alleged-to-have-planted-drugs-f89109dc196e">article containing leaked files</a> from a Dothan Police department’s internal affairs investigation that detailed accusations made by multiple police officers against a narcotics team planting drugs and weapons on black men. In the article was a photo of members of the team and Dothan Police Chief Steve Parrish which Carroll alleged was the "Commander" of the local Sons of Confederate Veterans group and had named his son after the founder of the Ku Klux Klan.

 <p>
 Local white supremacy groups and police officers that were members the <a href="https://scv.org">Sons of Confederate Veterans</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_the_South">League of the South</a> accused the newspaper of hacking the prosecutor’s and police department's files that revealed transcripts of interviews with confidential informants acknowledging officers instructing the informants to plant drugs. A Dothan city official labled newspaper a "domestic terrorist" for their interviews with "alleged" victims. In response Carroll published intercepted text messages that appeared to indicate the city official offering young men money for sex and video of him chaining two young black men the the door of a courthouse along with a leaked a FBI document that listed his business partner on a white supremacist list.
<p>

<p>
The article resulted in a U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights investigation of which the results have never been made public. The Dothan Police Chief Steve Parrish and District Attorney Doug Valeska denied they had ever had a single complaint. Over 6 million people shared the article. Carroll, refused interviews or to share the files with the Southern Poverty Law Center due to agreement with his sources which led to pushback by the center who demanded access to them.
 
 The city embarked on a aggresive  pushback campaign aided by the local newspaper the Dothan Eagle to convice the community the articles about Valeska and Police department were "false" and "unsubstantiated" and that the Harvard corruption ranking was flawed. However the former head of the internal affairs department Keith Gray came forward and corroborated the story and confirmed the documents being authentic.

 <p>
 
 Members of white supremacy groups subsequently threatened to kill Carroll's mother who was in a local nursing home / rehab facility and cattle were poisoned on his family farm. 
 
In 2016 several Ozark Police Department officers <a href="http://media.graytvinc.com/documents/Carroll_Jon_Lawsuit.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> against the newspaper for defamation. Former Police Chiefs John White (Dothan) and Tony Spivey (Ozark), along with officers Rex Tipton, Eddy Henderson and Keith Cauthen alleged an article, which claimed a Ozark reserve officer had come forward and claimed a former officer had involvement in the 1999 murders of J.B. Beasley and Tracie Hawlett, was false.
 However, the officer held to her story when interviewed by the police department and Houston County Deputy Donovan Arias. The Attorney General's Cold Case unit, Special Agent Shawn Smith acknowledged the officer did make the claim and had been interviewed contradicting the officer's claims against the newspaper.
 
 <p>Carroll, then in Washington state, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16259833/7/1/carroll-v-white/"> filed a first amendment retaliation suit</a> in federal court. Attempts to have the suit dismissed failed and the judge ruled in the newspaper's favor. Meetings secretly recorded of the officer’s lawyers surfaced revealing in order to drop the suit they wanted Carroll to retract the story, publish false articles supportive of the district attorney and the newspaper's law enforcement sources revealed. Carroll refused to identify the sources citing the state's <a href="https://www.rcfp.org/privilege-compendium/alabama/">strict sheild law</a> and was willing to be jailed before revealing them if neccesary. After these recordings were leaked they made allegations that Carroll had hacked the law firm's digital devices and used them to record conversations they deemed legally privileged. Carroll denied these claims.
 <p>
In 2018 the lawsuit were dismissed in the newspaper’s favor. This occurred only after it filed for bankruptcy which removed the cases from local Alabama courts where the plantiffs had to face a federal judge in the Tenth Circuit and multiple countersuits. The case, which provided no evidence of defamation, were dismissed. Carroll then dropped his lawsuits and was reimbursed for his legal expense. The newspaper was then closed as it's financial resources depleted by the legal battles and Pelham and Carroll no longer lived in Alabama. At its peak the newspaper had 20,000 subscribers and over 7 million visits annually to its web site.
  <p>
   <strong> Criticism:</strong>
   <hr>
   Criticism of the newspaper was widespread in the regions segregated white community in part for its focus on the black communities and hyperbolic language. However it is hard to determine the truth in the region's newspaper reporting who largely ignored the stories the <i>Henry County Reporter</i> broke. The Dothan Eagle, led by Lance Griffen and Matt Elofson, attempted to smear the newspaper and label them only "bloggers". However the <i>Henry County Reporter</i> broke several national stories they had ignored reaching millions of readers. At one point multiple articles on the Henry County Reporter (non-profit) had over a million views which surpassed the entire annual readership of the Dothan Eagle (for profit). The Dothan Eagle ultimately became bankrupt and was acquired by Berkshire Hathaway.
   <p>
   Another frequent criticism is Pelham and  Carroll went after District Attorney Doug Valeska for personal reasons that had nothing to do with journalism. Both deny these claims. However in a 2018 Austin Texas podcast open mic moment Carroll described a meeting with Valeska where his girlfriend had a daughter that was sexually molested by a former county official that was a political supporter of Valeska. The county's Dept of Child Services (DHR) and the police chief wanted to press charges but Valeska blocked them. Reportly by those present in the meeting Carroll warned Valeska and he alleged Carroll threatened him when he said "we're going to dance motherf@#*%r". After a formal complaint the FBI determined Carroll did not threaten Valeska physically. 
 Its fair to say they did "dance" politically for three long years of political drama in south Alabama resulting in Valeska leaving office in disgrace and abandoning hope of becoming the next attorney general for the state. 
 <p>

 <p>In 2017 a judge connected to former district attorney Valeska illegally outed Carroll as a former undercover officer and an ex-wife and organization in Dothan (Dothan for Justice Now) claimed Carroll was a former intelligence officer when photos surfaced of him in the middle east.
 Carroll denied the claims but acknowleged having served as a sworn officer in a police departement.
 
   <p>
   <strong> Post Closing:</strong>
   <hr>
   Pelham and Carroll staked a successful online newspaper's future on bringing truth out and succeeded to some degree, but failed in anticipating the resistance by the judical system they criticized to tie them up in local courts in retaliation.
   Their core arguments remain valid that the 20th judical district should grant new trials to the hundreds of cases that former District Attorney Doug Valeska prosecuted (in office for 32 years) convicting black men with white-only juries. Supporting their position is a recent June 2019 Supreme court ruling in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-9572_k536.pdf">Flowers v. Mississippi</a>. They additionally advocated all individuals who were convicted based on narcotics officers that had internal affairs files documenting other officers witnessing drug planting and missing evidence be overturned or granted new trials.
   Thus far the new district attorney, Pat Jones has refused to do so and "wants to look forward not backward". The late NAACP President for Dothan Paul Carroll believed that "there are over a hundred of these men remaining prison".
   FBI agents have described it "as too big of a problem to address" and it should be left to history".
   
  
   <p>A formal complaint was filed with the Alabama State Bar’s disciplinary committee against former District Attorney Doug Valeska by former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Sue Bell Cobb that <strong>he had given false statements</strong> to the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.
 <p>The U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals found District Attorney Doug Valeska’s behavior <strong>“unconstitutional and unethical”</strong> in a 1997 death penalty case and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6353288-Artez-Hammonds-Opinion-on-Doug-Valeska.html">forwarded a complaint to the Alabama State Bar</a>. “We are very disturbed by Valeska’s behavior. Not only did Valeska intentionally refer to Hammonds’s decision not to testify, but <strong>he did so in flagrant violation of the court’s pre-trial order… Valeska had been reprimanded in prior cases for engaging in precisely the same unconstitutional and unethical behavior.”</strong> 
  
<p>After the closing of the Henry County Reporter a former prosecutor came forward and vindicated the newspaper’s reporting stating they "were aware of nearly one hundred complaints regarding drug planting by the Dothan police department". A former assistant district attorney went on record acknowledging he "had seen false and malicious prosecutions by the district attorney". A former narcotics agent in the judicial district went on record in an interview acknowledging "specific people in the black community were targeted and he had personally witnessed drug planting in Henry county".
In 2019 the results of a Justice Department investigation were leaked that revealed documents acknowledging widespread complaints of drug planting vindicating the newspaper’s earlier reporting.
 <p>
Pelham continues to write and lives in Pennsylvania and is involved in energy and trucking business, Carroll continues his documentary photography and raises cattle. His long term partner and girlfriend reportedly has banned him from writing for or even reading newspapers. 
  In 2017 his photography and film in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twT0u1KEFpE">No Man's Land</a> was nominated Best Documentary Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival and the Best Documentary Film at the Gasparilla International Film Festival in 2018.

<strong>The Henry County Reporter</strong>, originally the Barbour-Henry Reporter, was a weekly online newspaper that served the community of Alabama from 2010-2016. Co-founded by Robbie Pelham and Jon B. Carroll, it featured articles written by Teresa Crozier, Felicia Palmer, LaDonna Stinson, Penny Rogers, Kenny Glasgow, Robbie Pelham, and Jon B. Carroll and Bettie Carroll. Pelham served as it’s editor and Carroll it’s primary photographer.

Two Henry County natives, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recy_Taylor"> Recy Taylor</a> and Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Grover C. Hall were the inspiration behind its creation. Hall wrote in the 1930’s speaking out against the Klan in south Alabama and was an early advocate for the Civil Rights movement while writing in the <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/title_7946/alabama_journal/">Alabama Journal</a>. 

In 2010 local officials removed a sign honoring Hall due to his support of the civil rights movement and later refused to allow a opening of the film about Recy Taylor that received global recognition in <a href="https://www.therapeofrecytaylor.com">The Rape of Recy Taylor by Nancy Buirski</a>. 

<p> Carroll's mother, Bettie Carroll was in the nursing home of Abbeville Alabama where Taylor resided before her death in 2017. In conversations with Taylor Carroll was convinced that voices in the community were deeply marginalized and this contributed to her was being denied justice after being gang a raped by priming Abbeville men due to her race. Despite one still living the district attorney’s office refused to charge him in the crime. Pelham and Carroll, both white, credit Recy Taylor for enabling them to see the embedded racism that plagues the community.
 
<p>“The Reporter” as it was known locally often covered issues of judicial and legislative corruption in what is frequently described as a “news desert” in southeast Alabama. 
Harvard University’s Edward Safra Center for Government Ethics ranked the region as having one of the most corrupt judicial systems in the United States.
In 2013 they received a grant from the Highlander Research and Education center to use media addressing marginalized voices in the minority community.

  <strong> CONTROVERSY</strong>
  <p>
The newspaper became extremely controversial among white residents that supported continued segregation and linked to white supremacy groups as it focused on exposing racial and judicial disparity issues in the courts that the nearby Dothan Eagle and Abbeville Herald refused to cover. 
  <p>Pelham published a series of articles and interviews about the Eufaula Police Chief Ralph Connor’s shooting or an unarmed man named Cameron Massey. Pelham reveled a background check had not been performed before the chief’s hire that would have revealed another shooting of an unarmed black man in the back while he was a police officer in Montgomery Alabama. The city had settled with the family of that victim. The chief subsequently resigned.

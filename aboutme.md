 <strong> History:</strong> 
 <hr>
Two Henry County natives, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recy_Taylor"> Recy Taylor</a> and Pulitzer prize-winning journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_C._Hall">Grover C. Hall</a> were the inspiration behind its creation. Hall wrote in the 1930’s speaking out against the Klan in southeast Alabama and was an early advocate for the Civil Rights movement while writing in the <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/title_7946/alabama_journal/">Alabama Journal</a>. 
In 2010 officials removed a sign honoring Hall due to his support of the civil rights movement and later refused to allow a opening of the film in Abbeville about Recy Taylor that received global recognition in <a href="https://www.therapeofrecytaylor.com">The Rape of Recy Taylor</a> by Nancy Buirski. Pelham and Carroll launched the newspaper in response.
 
<p>“The Reporter” as it was known locally covered issues of judicial and legislative corruption in what is described as the “news desert” of southeast Alabama. 
<a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/measuring-illegal-and-legal-corruption-american-states-some-results-safra">Harvard University’s Edward Safra Center for Government Ethics</a> ranked the region as having one of the most corrupt judicial systems in the United States.
In 2013 it received a grant from the <a href="https://www.highlandercenter.org">Highlander Research and Education Center</a> to address marginalized voices in the community. Carroll was awarded the Zilphia P. Horton grant training him as a community advocate.

  <strong> Controversy:</strong>
 <hr>
The newspaper became controversial among residents linked to white supremacy groups as it exposed issues of racial disparity in the courts that the Dothan Eagle and Abbeville Herald (local newspapers) had long ignored.
   
  <p>Pelham published a series of articles and interviews about the Eufaula Police Chief Ralph Connor’s shooting of an unarmed man Cameron Massey. Pelham revealed a background check had not been performed before the chief’s hire that would have revealed another shooting of an unarmed black man in the back while he was a police officer in Montgomery Alabama. The city had settled with the family of that victim. 
The newspaper then published leaked bodycam footgage from the shooting indicating Massey was unarmed and wearing a seatbelt and passenger in the car while shot. The chief subsequently resigned and Pelham's story recieved national attention and was picked up by Buzzfeed and the New Republic.
   <p>
   Carroll wrote a weekly column about livestock and that routinely focused on the district attorney for Henry and Houston counties (20th judicial district) that led to him leaving office. The articles contained hundreds of leaked documents revealed the prosecutor’s office corruption and racism which were picked up by the New York Times. These editorials exposed the prosecutor’s office targeted minorities and arranged all-white juries to convict black defendants and interviews of it's victims.

 In 2014 Carroll wrote a series of articles about Kharon Davis, an inmate held in the Houston county jail for nearly a decade and denied a trial. The local newspaper, the Dothan Eagle, long a supporter of the prosecutor and police department, refused to publish information about the case nor would the district attorney’s office acknowledge the case. Carroll broke the story by interviewing the mother and then met with the New York Time’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/us/alabama-kharon-davis-speedy.html">Serge Kovawleski who ran a series of articles</a> that brought national attention. Davis remains the longest-held person arrested for a crime and denied a trial in American jurisprudence history.

  <strong> Lawsuits:</strong>
<hr>
In 2015 Carroll published the <a href="https://medium.com/@jonbcarroll/leaked-documents-reveal-dothan-police-department-alleged-to-have-planted-drugs-f89109dc196e">most controversial article,</a> containing leaked secret files from a Dothan Police department’s internal affairs investigation that detailed accusations made by multiple police officers against a narcotics team that was planting drugs and weapons on black men. In the article was a photo of members of the team and Dothan Police Chief Steve Parrish which Carroll alleged was the "Commander" of the local Sons of Confederate Veterans group and had named his son after the founder of the Ku Klux Klan.
 Local white supremacy groups and police officers tied to the <a href="https://scv.org">Sons of Confederate Veterans</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_the_South">League of the South</a> accused the newspaper of hacking the prosecutor’s and police department's files that revealed transcripts of interviews with confidential informants acknowledging officers instructing the informants to plant drugs. A Dothan city official labled Carroll a "domestic terrorist" for his interviews with "alleged" victims of the judicial system. In response Carroll published intercepted text messages that appeared to indicate the official offering young men money for sex and video of him chaining two young black men the the door of a courthouse along with a leaked a FBI document that listed his business partner and family members on a white supremecist list.

<p>
The article resulted in a U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights investigation of which the results have never been made public. The Dothan Police Chief and District Attorney denied they had ever had a single complaint. Over 6 million people shared the article. Carroll, however, refused interviews with national media or to share the files with the Southern Poverty Law Center due to agreements with his source which led to pushback by the center who demanded access to them.
 Carroll did grant 60 minutes producer Megan Towey temporary access.
 Members of white supremacy groups subsequently threatened to kill Carroll's mother who was in a local nursing home / rehab facility and cattle were posioned on his family farm. 
 
In 2016 several officers filed lawsuits against the newspaper for defamation. Former Police Chiefs John White (Dothan) and Tony Spivey (Ozark), along with Lt. Rex Tipton and Deputy Keith Cauthen alleged an article, which claimed a Ozark reserve officer had come forward and claimed a former officer had involvement in the 1999 murders of J.B. Beasley and Tracie Hawlett, was false.
 However, the officer held to her story when interviewed by the police department and Houston County Deputy Donovan Arias. The Attorney General's Cold Case unit, Special Agent Shawn Smith acknowledged the officer did make the claim and had been interviewed contradicting the officer's claims against Carroll.
 
 <p>Carroll, then in Washington state working on a documentary film about the takeover of the Malheur wildlife refuge, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16259833/7/1/carroll-v-white/"> filed a first amendment retaliation suit</a> in federal court. Meetings secretly recorded of the police officer’s lawyers reveal in order to drop the suit they wanted Carroll to retract the story, publish false articles supportive of the district attorney and the newspaper's law enforcement sources revealed. Carroll refused to identify the sources citing the state's <a href="https://www.rcfp.org/privilege-compendium/alabama/">strict sheild law</a> and was willing to be jailed before revealing them if neccesary. After these recordings were leaked they made allegations that Carroll had hacked the law firm's digital devices and used them to record conversations they deemed legally privileged. Carroll denied these claims.
 <p>
In 2018 the lawsuits were dismissed in the newspaper’s favor. This occurred only after it filed for bankruptcy which removed the cases from the local Alabama courts where the plantiffs had to faced a federal judge in the Tenth Circuit and multiple countersuits. The case, which provided no evidence of defamation, were dismissed. Carroll in return dropped his lawsuits and was reimbursed for his legal expenses. The newspaper was then closed as Pelham and Carroll no longer lived in Alabama.

   <strong> Criticism:</strong>
   <hr>
   Criticism of the newspaper was widespread in the white community in part for its focus on the black community and hyperbolic language. However it is hard to determine the truth in the region's newspaper reporting who largely ignored the stories the <i>Henry County Reporter</i> broke. The Dothan Eagle, led by Lance Griffen and Matt Elofson, attempted to smear the newspaper and label them only "bloggers". However the <i>Henry County Reporter</i> broke several national stories they had ignored reaching millions of readers. At one point multiple articles on the Henry County Reporter (non-profit) had over a million views which surpassed the entire annual readership of the Dothan Eagle (for profit). The Dothan Eagle ultimately became bankrupt and was acquired by Berkshire Hathaway.
   <p>
   Another frequent criticism is Carroll went after District Attorney Doug Valeska for personal reasons that had nothing to do with journalism. Both Pelham and Carroll deny these claims. However in a 2018 Austin Texas podcast Carroll described a meeting with Valeska where his girlfriend had a daughter that was sexually molested by a former county official that was a political supporter of Valeska. The county's Dept of Child Services (DHR) wanted to press charges but Valeska blocked it. Reportly by those present in the meeting Carroll warned Valeska "are you sure you want to dance with me". Valeska then alleged Carroll threatened him when he said "we're going to dance motherf@#*%r". After a formal complaint the FBI determined Carroll did not threaten Valeska physically.
 But no doubt they did "dance" politically for three long years of high stakes political drama in south Alabama resulting in Valeska leaving office in disgrace and abandoning all hope of becoming the next attorney general for the state. 
 In 2017 a judge connected to former district attorney Valeska criminally outed Carroll as a former undercover officer and an ex-wife and organization in Dothan (Dothan for Justice Now) claimed that Carroll was a former intelligence officer when photos surfaced of him in the middle east.
 Carroll denied the claims but acknowleged having served as a sworn officer in a police departement.

   <strong> Post Closing:</strong>
   <hr>
<p>After the closing of the Henry County Reporter a former prosecutor came forward and vindicated the newspaper’s reporting stating they "were aware of nearly one hundred complaints regarding drug planting by the Dothan police department". A former assistant district attorney went on the record acknowledging he "had seen false and malicious prosecutions by the district attorney". A former narcotics agent in the judicial district went on record in an interview acknowledging "specific people in the black community were targeted and he had personally witnessed drug planting in Henry county".
In 2019 the results of a Justice Department investigation were leaked that revealed documents acknowledging widespread complaints of drug planting vindicating the newspaper’s earlier reporting.
 <p>
Pelham continues to write and lives in Pennsylvania and Carroll in Alabama where continues his photography and raises cattle. His long term partner and girlfriend reportedly has banned him from writing for or even reading newspapers. In 2017 his photography and film work in "No Man's land" was nominated Best Documentary Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017 and the Best Documentary Film at the Gasparilla International Film Festival in 2018.

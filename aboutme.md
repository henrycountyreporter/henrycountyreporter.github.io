<strong>The Henry County Reporter</strong>, originally the Barbour-Henry Reporter, was a weekly online newspaper that served the community of Alabama from 2010-2016. Co-founded by Robbie Pelham and Jon B. Carroll, it featured articles written by Teresa Crozier, Felicia Palmer, LaDonna Stinson, Penny Rogers, Kenny Glasgow, Robbie Pelham, and Jon B. Carroll and Bettie Carroll. Pelham served as it’s editor and Carroll it’s primary photographer.

Two Henry County natives, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recy_Taylor"> Recy Taylor</a> and Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Grover C. Hall were the inspiration behind its creation. Hall wrote in the 1930’s speaking out against the Klan in south Alabama and was an early advocate for the Civil Rights movement while writing in the <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/title_7946/alabama_journal/">Alabama Journal</a>. 

In 2010 local officials removed a sign honoring Hall due to his support of the civil rights movement and later refused to allow a opening of the film about Recy Taylor that received global recognition in <a href="https://www.therapeofrecytaylor.com">The Rape of Recy Taylor by Nancy Buirski</a>. 

<p> Carroll's mother, Bettie Carroll was in the nursing home of Abbeville Alabama where Taylor resided before her death in 2017. In conversations with Taylor Carroll was convinced that voices in the community were deeply marginalized and this contributed to her was being denied justice after being gang a raped by priming Abbeville men due to her race. Despite one still living the district attorney’s office refused to charge him in the crime. Pelham and Carroll, both white, credit Recy Taylor for enabling them to see the embedded racism that plagues the community.
 
<p>“The Reporter” as it was known locally often covered issues of judicial and legislative corruption in what is frequently described as a “news desert” in southeast Alabama. 
Harvard University’s Edward Safra Center for Government Ethics ranked the region as having one of the most corrupt judicial systems in the United States.
In 2013 they received a grant from the Highlander Research and Education center to use media addressing marginalized voices in the minority community.

  <strong> Controversy:</strong>
  <p>
The newspaper became extremely controversial among white residents that supported continued segregation and linked to white supremacy groups as it focused on exposing racial and judicial disparity issues in the courts that the nearby Dothan Eagle and Abbeville Herald refused to cover. 
  <p>Pelham published a series of articles and interviews about the Eufaula Police Chief Ralph Connor’s shooting or an unarmed man Cameron Massey. Pelham revealed a background check had not been performed before the chief’s hire that would have revealed another shooting of an unarmed black man in the back while he was a police officer in Montgomery Alabama in 1983. The city had settled with the family of that victim. 
The newspaper then publsihed leaked bodycam footgage from the shooting that indicated Massey appeared to have given no to be shot. The chief subsequently resigned and Pelhams story recieved national attention and was picked up by Buzzfeed and the New Republic.
   <p>
   Carroll wrote a weekly editorial that often focused on the district attorney for Henry and Houston counties that led to him seeking early retirement. The editorials contained hundrrds of leaked documents revealed the prosecutor’s office corruption and racism which were picked up by the New York Times. The Time's further exposed Doug Valeska’s alleged abuses targeting minorities and arranging all-white juries to convict black defendants. 
    <p>In 2014 Carroll wrote a series about an inmate named Kharon Davis that had been held in the county jail for nearly a decade while denied a trial. The local newspaper (Dothan Eagle) had refused to publish any information about at the request of the mother nor would the district attorney’s office acknowledge the case to the public. Carroll broke the story by interviewing the mother and then met with the New York Time’s Serge Kovawleski who ran a series of articles that brought national attention. Davis remains the longest-held person arrested for a crime and denied a trial in American jurisprudence history ( 11 years). 
     <p>Local white supremacy groups and police officers tied to the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the League of the South accused Carroll of hacking the prosecutor’s files that revealed transcripts of interviews with confidential informants acknowledging officers instructing the informants to plant drugs. In response Dothan city officals (E911 Coordinator) labled Carroll a "domestic terroist". In response Carroll published intercepted text messages that appeared to indicate the married man offering young men money for sex and video of him chaining to young black men the the door of a courthouse.
      
   <p>   
In 2017 Carroll published the most controversial article in the newspaper's history containing leaked secret files from a Dothan Police department’s internal affairs investigation that detailed accusations made by multiple police officers against a narcotics officer that was planting drugs and weapons on black men. This resulted in a U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights investigation of which the results have never been made public. The Dothan Police Chief and District Attorney denied they had ever had a complaint. Over 6 million people shared the article worldwide. Carroll, however, refused to share the files ( several hundred ) with the Southern Poverty Law Center due honoring an agreement with his source which led to pushback by the center who demanded access to them. Members of white supremacy groups threatened Carroll, cattle were poisoned on his family farm. Multiple officers then filed lawsuits against the newspaper for defamation. Former Ozark Police Chief Tony Spivey, Rex Tipton and Keith Cauthen claimed that the article, which revealed a reserve officer had come forward and given a statement that former officers at the department had involvement in the 1999 murders of J.B. Beasley and Tracie Hawlett.
 Howevever the reserve officer held to her story when interviewed by the police department and a Hourston county deputy. The Attorney General's Cold Case unit head, agent Shawn Smith came forward and acknowledged that the officer did in fact claim this and had been inteviewed.
 
 <p>The newspaper and Carroll, then a resident of Washington state filed a first amendment retaliation suit against them in federal court. Meetings secretly recorded by an attorney with the police officer’s lawyers reveal they wanted Carroll to retract the story and publish false articles supportive of local judges and prosecutors and wanted the newspaper's sources revealed. After these recordings became known they made allegations that Carroll had hacked the law firms' digital devices and used them to record conversations they deemed private and legally privileged. Carroll denied the claims.
 <p>
The lawsuits that ultimately were dismissed and or settled in the newspaper’s favor. This occurred only after he filed for the newspaper’s bankruptcy which removed the cases from the local Alabama courts where faced a federal judge in the Tenth Circuit of Colorado. The cases which provided no evidence of their allegations of defamation were all subsequently dismissed and one settled in Carroll’s favor. Carroll in return dropped his lawsuits and was reimbursed for his legal expenses. the newspaper was then closed permanently.
  
<p>After the closing former prosecutor came forward and vindicated the newspaper’s reporting stating that they were aware of nearly one hundred complaints regarding drug planting by the Dothan police department. A former assitant district attorney went on the record acknowledging that he had seen false and malicious prosecutions by the district attorney. A former narcotics agent in the judicial district went on the record acknowledged that specific people in the community were targeted and he had personally witnessed drug planting in Henry county.
In 2019 the results of a Justice Department investigation were leaked that revealed documents acknowledging widespread complaints of drug planting vindicating the newspaper’s earlier reporting.
 <p>
Pelham continues to write and lives in Pennsylvania and Carroll in Alabama where continues his photography and raises cattle. In 2017 his photography and film work became part of a documentary that was nominated Best Documentary Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017 and the Best Documentary Film at the Gasparilla International Film Festival in 2018.
